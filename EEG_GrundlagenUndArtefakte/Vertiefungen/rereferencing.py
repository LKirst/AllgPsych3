In diesem Tutorial wird euch demonstriert, welchen Einfluss die Wahl einer
Referenzelektrode auf die Daten hat. Daf√ºr rereferenzieren wir die Daten mit 
unterschiedlichen Referenzelektroden.

die Daten geladen werden ("Loading the raw data") ueberspringen!

# %% Background

# EEG measures a voltage (difference in electric potential) between each
# electrode and a reference electrode. This means that whatever signal is
# present at the reference electrode is effectively subtracted from all the
# measurement electrodes. Therefore, an ideal reference signal is one that
# captures *none* of the brain-specific fluctuations in electric potential,
# while capturing *all* of the environmental noise/interference that is being
# picked up by the measurement electrodes.
#
# In practice, this means that the reference electrode is often placed in a
# location on the subject's body and close to their head (so that any
# environmental interference affects the reference and measurement electrodes
# similarly) but as far away from the neural sources as possible (so that the
# reference signal doesn't pick up brain-based fluctuations). Typical reference
# locations are the subject's earlobe, nose, mastoid process, or collarbone.
# Each of these has advantages and disadvantages regarding how much brain
# signal it picks up (e.g., the mastoids pick up a fair amount compared to the
# others), and regarding the environmental noise it picks up (e.g., earlobe
# electrodes may shift easily, and have signals more similar to electrodes on
# the same side of the head).
#
# Even in cases where no electrode is specifically designated as the reference,
# EEG recording hardware will still treat one of the scalp electrodes as the
# reference, and the recording software may or may not display it to you (it
# might appear as a completely flat channel, or the software might subtract out
# the average of all signals before displaying, making it *look like* there is
# no reference).

# Here's how the data looks in its original state:

# add new reference channel (all zero); this function returns a copy

# %% Rereference to linked mastoids

raw_linkedmastoids = raw_new_ref.set_eeg_reference(ref_channels=['M1', 'M2'])

# %% Average reference
# The average reference is a virtual reference that is the average of all channels.
