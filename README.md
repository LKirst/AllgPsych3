This repository contains the code for figures, analyses and example experiments, which will be used in the course "Allgemeine Psychologie 3".
This short course is an introduction into Neuroimaging and most of the course focuses on Electroencephalography (EEG).

For now, much of the code is insufficiently documented. 
In my research, I use neither the OpenBCI EEG for measuring EEG nor MNE for analysis. 
But I use them in this course because they are better suited for demnonstration purposes than the hard- and software we normally use at my lab.
Because I am learning about these tools alongside the course, some of the code may be a bit clumsy and contain bugs.

## Prerequisites

* [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html) for EEG analysis
* [Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html) for experiments

For EEG, I use a Cyton + Daisy + Mark IV headset setup from [OpenBCI] (https://docs.openbci.com/docs/04AddOns/01-Headwear/MarkIV).

## Installing

If you have Git installed, you can just clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/LKirst/AllgPsych3.git
```

Otherwise, you can download the zip folder.
For that, press the button *Clone or download* at the top of this page and select *Download ZIP*.
Then, unzip the download in your folder of choice.


## Contributing

I would happily accept contributions to improve the code.
