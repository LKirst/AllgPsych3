This repository contains the code for figures, analyses and example experiments, which will be used in the course "Allgemeine Psychologie 3".
This short course is an introduction into Neuroimaging and most of the course focuses on Electroencephalography (EEG).

For now, much of the code is insufficiently documented. 
In my research, I don't use MNE for analysis. But I use it here, because it is better suited for demonstration purposes than the software, we normally use at my lab.
Because I am learning about MNE alongside the course, some of the code may be a bit clumsy and contain bugs.

## Prerequisites

* [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html) for EEG analysis.
* [Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html) for the example experiment.

## Installing

If you have Git installed, you can just clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/LKirst/AllgPsych3.git
```

If you don't have Git, you can download the zip folder.
For that, press the button *Clone or download* at the top of this page and select *Download ZIP*.
Then, unzip the download in your folder of choice.

## Contributing

I would happily accept contributions to improve the code.
